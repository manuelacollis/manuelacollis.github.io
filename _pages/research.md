<div style="font-size: 1.1em;"><strong>Whether to Apply (2024)  <i> -  Management Science 70, no. 7: 4649-4669. </i></strong><br>
with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/kbaldigacoffman/">Katherine Baldiga Coffman</a> and Leena Kulkarni</div>
<p> <b><i>Abstract:</i></b> Labor market outcomes depend, in part, upon an individual’s willingness to put herself forward 
for different opportunities. We use a series of experiments to explore gender differences in willingness to apply for 
higher return, more challenging work. We find that, in male-typed domains, qualified women are significantly less likely 
to apply than similarly well-qualified men. We provide evidence both in a controlled setting and in the field that reducing 
ambiguity surrounding required qualifications increases the rate at which qualified women apply. The effects are more mixed 
for men. Our results suggest a path for increasing the pool of qualified women applicants. <br>

<div style="font-size: 1.1em;"><strong>Stereotypes and Belief Updating (2024) <i> - Journal of the European Economic Association 22, no. 3:1011-1054. </i></strong><br>
with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/kbaldigacoffman/">Katherine Baldiga Coffman</a> and Leena Kulkarni</div>
<p><b><i>Abstract:</i></b> We explore how feedback shapes, and perpetuates, gender gaps in self-assessments. Participants 
in our experiments take tests of their ability across different domains. Absent feedback, beliefs of own 
ability are strongly influenced by gender stereotypes: holding own ability fixed, individuals are more 
confident in more gender congruent domains (i.e. more male-typed for men, more female-typed for 
women). After feedback, stereotypes continue to shape posterior beliefs, even beyond what a Bayesian 
model would predict. This is primarily because both men and women update their beliefs more positively 
in response to good news when it arrives in a more gender congruent domain.  <br>

<div style="font-size: 1.1em;"><strong>Sexual Misconduct and Scientific Production <i> - Job Market Paper </i></strong></div>
<p> <b><i>Abstract:</i></b> While sexual misconduct in the workplace has complex and lasting consequences for directly affected individuals, its broader organizational implications remain less well understood. Using a novel dataset of over 1,000 documented sexual misconduct cases across U.S. universities, I examine how these incidents affect departmental scientific productivity. These are misconduct cases that experienced subsequent public reporting, for the most part through news reporting. Using the benefit of hindsight, I record the year sexual misconduct occurs and the year it becomes public. I employ coarsened exact matching and a staggered difference-in-differences design to compare control departments with those that experienced subsequently publicized misconduct incidents. Sexual misconduct shows no discernible effect on productivity in most departments when it occurs, but public reporting &mdash; for example, through media outlets &mdash; reduces publications by 0.1 per faculty member annually, equivalent to ten fewer publications over five years for a 20-member department. This work suggests that organizations might find themselves in a double bind where they have to balance responding to calls for increased transparency while being required to protect the privacy of all parties involved against the organizational costs arising from public discourse about sexual misconduct incidents.<br>

<div style="font-size: 1.1em;"><strong>Workplace Hostility (2025)</strong> <br>
with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/vaneffenterreclementine/home">Clémentine Van Effenterre</a></div>
<p> <b><i>Abstract:</i></b> Workplace hostility is one of the main drivers of employee resignation. We investigate how much individuals value a workplace free of hostility and whether this can be offset with hybrid or solo work arrangements. We conduct a choice survey experiment with 2,048 participants, recruited among upper-year students, recent graduates, and alums from a large public university. Our experiment shows that people are willing to forgo a significant portion of their earnings to avoid hostile work environments—15 to 30 percent of their wage. Women report a stronger preference for inclusive workplaces and environments free of sexual harassment. We also find that women value hybrid work twice as much in the presence of sexual harassment and value teamwork more in non- inclusive environments. We propose a model of compensating differentials to understand how the presence of hostility shapes the demand for alternative work arrangements and to implement policy counterfactuals. <br>

<div style="font-size: 1.1em;"><strong>Institutional Determinants of Gender Diversity in Science: Evidence from the German Reunification (2023)</strong></div>
<p> <b><i>Abstract:</i></b> Gender diversity is a key driver of the rate and direction of innovative activities, but we know little about how to achieve it. A rapidly growing literature that focuses on patenting documents a persistent gender gap in innovative activities. I look at the pipeline of potential female inventors and study women's decisions to complete graduate school and their propensity and intensity to publish under two different institutional and normative settings. To explore this question, I turn to the German reunification in 1990 as my empirical setting. At that time, East and West Germany show sizable differences in institutional incentives and attitudes toward working women. Using a newly assembled dataset of German Ph.D. graduates in STEM fields, I show that East Germany graduates significantly and persistently more women doctorates than West Germany. A difference-in-difference approach infers that the change in institutions, policies, and norms increase the gender gap in the intensity to publish. Taken together, this case study offers insights into how to increase gender diversity in science. <br>

<div style="font-size: 1.1em;"><strong>Productivity under Hostility</strong><br>
with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/vaneffenterreclementine/home">Clémentine Van Effenterre</a></div>
<p> <b><i>Abstract:</i></b> We propose a laboratory experiment to explore how hostile work environment impacts individual and group performance differentially by gender. We study behaviors in a contribution game with five rounds. Our experiment has two levels of randomization. After completing a baseline performance measurement,  individuals are randomly assigned to a group of 4.The gender composition of the group varies accordingly to two treatments: 1F3M, 3F1M. The quality of the work environment in the experiment is randomized to be either friendly or unfriendly and is randomized at the group level. Participants are able to communicate with their team members and the variation in work environment is introduced by the content of messages. Participants are able to select one or more messages among twelve pre-specified messages. They can also decide not to send any messages. These messages are noisy in the sense that a computer sometimes augments a group member and sends a message on their behalf. We test the effect of hostility on individuals' contribution decisions and performance, individual’s self-reported stress level, perception of the quality of the work environment, and likelihood of participating in the experiment again. In the last part of the main experiment, we elicit their willingness-to-pay for payoff scheme, quality of exchange, and location.  <br>
