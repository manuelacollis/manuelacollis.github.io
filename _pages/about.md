<p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  I am a doctoral candidate at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto; a PhD Fellow at the
  <a href="https://www.gendereconomy.org/">Institute for Gender and the Economy (GATE)</a>; and a 2024–25
  <a href="https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca/">Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society (SRI)</a> graduate fellow and current affiliate.
</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  I hold an M.A. in Law and Diplomacy from the Fletcher School at Tufts University and a B.Sc. in Business Administration from the
  Bern University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland. Prior to my doctoral studies, I was a Research Associate at Harvard Business School.

  I am an organizational scholar motivated by research questions at the intersection of technology, innovation, and society. I study how organizations mediate the relationship between societal forces and technological progress, with particular attention to the social conditions that shape knowledge work and innovation outcomes. In practice, this means I work on problems that sit at the boundaries of various literatures, drawing on theories, methods, and perspectives from across the social sciences such as sociology, economics, and organizational behavior. I am committed to research transparency and reproducibility and thus pre-register my studies - including archival work - and provide replication files for my papers.
</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  Two convictions anchor my work. First, I am interested in technological innovation as a vehicle for raising living standards, and expanding personal freedoms. Second, I care about equal opportunity, upward mobility, and the full harnessing of talent and ideas — wherever they come from. These interests converge in my current and emerging research on how we can build organizations and institutions that enable both innovation and inclusion, and on understanding how to shape emerging technologies to center around societal benefits.
</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 30px;">
  In my current work, I examine how hostile and exclusionary conditions — from sexual misconduct and harassment to gendered institutional norms — generate organizational and societal costs that extend far beyond individual harm, affecting productivity, human capital allocation, and innovation outcomes. Using field, survey, and laboratory experiments alongside large-scale archival data, I apply advanced econometric methods to uncover the structural and behavioral mechanisms that perpetuate these disparities. My research contributes to literatures on workplace inequality, scientific production, and the evolving nature of work.
